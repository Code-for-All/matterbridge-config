<!-- Hi! How are you? I hope you're good. -->
<!-- This template will help you to connect your organization's Slack to Code for All's one. Type in answers in sections below. Opening an issue is starting a conversation here on Github, so we will be able to clarify any of your doubts later. -->


## What is your Slack's url?

https://myorg.slack.com


## List channels from Code for All that you want to have in your organization

<!-- Below we propose a list of default channels. If you don't want any just delete them from the list. -->

General ones:
- `#introductions` - Introduce yourself to the community! Where are you based, what do you work on, why do you expect from partnership in Code for All? 
- `#general` - Post here if no other channel is applicable. Post job offers.
- `#random` and others similar (ie. rename #eat-for-all to #random-eat-for-all)
- `#fundraising` - Sharing possibilities for fundraising for the network and cross-partner cooperation. 
- `#readingroom` - Aggregated news from all organizations via RSS bot
- `#wins` – Sharing our achievements throughout the year (if possible link related post). Posts will be used for external communication, yearly reports, donors 
- `#just-starting` – We share information about our new projects at their earliest stage to enable cooperation on them.
- `#events` - Purpose: Sharing events we are organizing or planning to attend. If you want to start start discussion about common session's proposals or other event-related talk start a subchannel (ie. #events-ogp-summit) and invite interested people there.
- `#staff-announcements` [private] – Key announcements to the Code for All network members. Just what you need to know. No chatter.
- `#members` [private] – [Official members](https://codeforall.org/members) of the Code for All network

Topical:
- `#sensors` - Hardware for social change
- `#consul` - Citizen-participation supported by Consul
- Do any projects you collaborate with others have relevant channels? Maybe it should be created..

Meta to our work:
- `#fellows` – A place to complain on government beaurocracy ;) 
- `#community_builders` - Brigade leaders, brigade network builders and all other community builders

Any other channels to connect?
- ?

**Info:** For each of such channels we will assume there is a channel prefixed `cfall-` in your organization. For example we will link CfAll's `#general` to `#cfall-general`. If that is not the case, please specify above how you want the channel to be named in your org.

**Info:** You might want some connections configured only one way. Messages from CfAll might be relayed to your Slack, but your messages won't be circled back. While we don't encourage that, if that's what you need please specify in a comment next to a channel on above list.

## Do you want any of your channels to be exposed in Code for All?

<!-- Maybe you want your #general channel (if it's public) to be exposed in CfAll as #your-org-general? -->

- ?


## Configuring the bot

<!-- We need a bot configured in your workspace that will relay messages to other bots in other organizations. -->

**Yes / no**

Did you create relevant channels in your org and invited there bot (`/invite @matterbridge` command) or invited Krzysztof to your org do that?
